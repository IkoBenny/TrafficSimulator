# ðŸš¦ TrafficSimulator

<details>
<summary>Project Background</summary>

An extension of the original TrafficSimulator Capstone Project for the Computer Science program at UMGC.

This version introduces a modular, builder-based architecture that allows users to dynamically create and simulate traffic elements such as cars and traffic lights. Built in Java using Threads, Listeners, and Event Handlers, this simulator offers a scrollable, interactive GUI and real-time processing of traffic behaviors.

<details>
<summary>Project Status</summary>

This project is in active maintenance and feature expansion. The original Capstone requirements have been met (see `TrafficLightDescription.PDF`), and this updated version adds builder tools, improved concurrency, and a more robust simulation engine.

<details>
<summary>Planned Changes</summary>

* Update landing view to display current time on load
* Add Dark Mode UI support
* Add in-context help and documentation overlays
* Display more components simultaneously in simulation panel
* Fix TrafficLight bug (stops only being visually updated)
* Add clean application shutdown on STOP press
* Improve scroll pane behavior for large simulations
* Enable real-time editing of simulation objects
* Add object save/load and reset simulation state

</details>

<details>
<summary>Design Patterns Explored</summary>

* **Builder Pattern** â€“ For dynamically constructing simulation objects
* **Command Pattern** â€“ Executes build actions for lights/cars
* **Mediator Pattern** â€“ Coordinates updates between model, view, and controller
* **Strategy Pattern** â€“ Encapsulates update logic for Cars and Lights
* **MVC Pattern** â€“ Separates core logic, GUI, and state

</details>

<details>
<summary>Concepts Explored</summary>

**Processing**

* Concurrent & Multi-threaded object simulation
* Scheduled updates and ticking using real-time logic
* Real-time GUI updates and event-driven processing

**Architecture**

* Modular and scalable simulation design
* Command-driven object creation system
* Scrollable pane for navigating simulation objects
* Clean separation of simulation, control logic, and rendering
